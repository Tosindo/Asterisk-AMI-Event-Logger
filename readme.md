Asterisk AMI Event Logger
------
This project was used to be able to manage multiple Asterisk Servers Events, we needed this to log for very specific events that we needed on an external APP.

#### Features:
- Multiple Asterisk AMI servers connection.
- Filters events and stores them on a log file, or database.
- Multiple database management for usage with multiple projects.
- EventClauses to specify which events go to which MySQL servers.



#### Todo:
- Add better error descriptions.
- Structure Code better.
- **Urgent**: Check if the connection with the servers as dropped and reconnect.
